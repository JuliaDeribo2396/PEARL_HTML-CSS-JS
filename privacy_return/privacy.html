                            and

                        <p>
                            How do you get my consent?
                            When you provide us with personal information to complete a transaction, verify your credit

                            How do I withdraw my consent?

                        <p>

                        </p>
                        <p>SECTION 4 - SHOPIFY</p>
                        <p>
                        Our store is hosted on Shopify Inc. They provide us with the online e-commerce platform that
                        allows us to sell our products and services to you.
                        Your data is stored through Shopify’s data storage, databases and the general Shopify
                        application. They store your data on a secure server behind a firewall.
                        For more insight, you may also want to read Shopify’s Terms of Service
                        (https://www.shopify.com/legal/terms) or Privacy Statement
                        (https://www.shopify.com/legal/privacy).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Payment:
                        If you choose a direct payment gateway to complete your purchase, then Shopify stores your
                        credit card data. It is encrypted through the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard
                        (PCI-DSS). Your purchase transaction data is stored only as long as is necessary to complete
                        your purchase transaction. After that is complete, your purchase transaction information is
                        deleted.
                        All direct payment gateways adhere to the standards set by PCI-DSS as managed by the PCI
                        Security Standards Council, which is a joint effort of brands like Visa, Mastercard, American
                        Express and Discover.
                        PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure handling of credit card information by our store and
                        its service providers.
                        </p>
                        <p>SECTION 5 - SECURITY</p>
                        <p>
                        To protect your personal information, we take reasonable precautions and follow industry best
                        practices to make sure it is not inappropriately lost, misused, accessed, disclosed, altered or
                        destroyed.
                        If you provide us with your credit card information, the information is encrypted using secure
                        socket layer technology (SSL) and stored with a AES-256 encryption. Although no method of
                        transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, we follow all PCI-DSS
                        requirements and implement additional generally accepted industry standards.
                        </p>

                        make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here that it has been updated, so that

                        any, we use and/or disclose it.
                        If our store is acquired or merged with another company, your information may be transferred to
                        the new owners so that we may continue to sell products to you.
                        </p>
